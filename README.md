ðŸ‘‹ - Hi, I'm @Jxhnny56 (Johnny) and I'm a junior in high school.

ðŸ‘€ - I'm interested in web development, and learning multiple different languages specifically within web development.

ðŸŒ± - Iâ€™m currently learning Python and I'm at an intermediate skill level when it comes to programming in general.

ðŸ§ª - I've recently started working on a social media platform called "Stemlio" with a growing team of 4 people.

My passion is programming and my goal is to eventually achieve a proficient level in that area.
I would also like to pursue a computer science major in college (Hopefully that works out!) :)
